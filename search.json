Therefore, rational choice according classical economist black option.new type roulette presented prototypical example prospect – choice two options explicit probabilities outcomes – used investigate decision-making risk. normative measure monetary reinforcements allows decision-researchers probe mechanisms underlying choice behavior. participants similar reference point, choosing option higher expected monetary payout straightforward (least mathematically speaking). However, decision accept risky gamble like may change ask someone annual income one-million dollars compared someone income fifty-thousand dollars.introduces idea diminishing marginal returns. value millionaire places certain three-thousand dollars (option 1 ) may enough dissuade probable four-thousand dollars. person, assured three-thousand dollars, though, much valuable gamble. idea formalized term ‘utility,’ coined Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli. Utiity refers subjective “moral value” decision’s outcome. Bernoulli wrote: (Daniel Bernoulli 1954)price item dependent thing equal everyone; utility, however, dependent particular circumstances person making estimate.Bernoulli’s concept formed basis von Neumman Morgenstern’s Expected Utility Theory (EUT). (Neumann Morgenstern, O. 1947) EUT suggest people – – choose manner maximizes expected utility. EUT axiomatized, validity called question. Notably, Allais paradox suggests rationality defined maximizing expected utility neglects specific element psychology risk: variance individuals’ psychological values.(Allais 1953)1979, Daniel Kahneman Amos Tversky published Prospect Theory: Analysis Decision Risk.(Kahneman Tversky 1979) Prospect theory critiqued descriptive validity EUT. Kahneman Tversky highlighted systematic ways people violated EUT. , instantiated field behavioral economics – wedding insights psychology quantitative models economics – better understand human choice behavior.Kahneman Tversky describe multiple deviations EUT. Notably, discuss certainty reflection effects. certainty effect describes people overweight outcomes considered certain relative probable ones. reflection effect – commonly known ‘loss aversion’ – accounts peoples tendency risk averse positive prospects risk seeking negative ones. addition effects, one key takeaway prospect theory value function corresponds changes wealth welfare, rather final states. value function, concave gains convex losses, losses steeper gains (goes hand--hand reflection effect).application behavioral insights theories human decision-making necessitate emotional component. discussed Graham Loomes Robert Sugden 1982 paper, Regret Theory: Alternative Rational Choice Uncertainty, anticipatory feelings regret used inform decisions.
