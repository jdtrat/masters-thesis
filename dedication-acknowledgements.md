# Dedication and Acknowledgements

> I dedicate my thesis to both my mom, Joanne Fink, and grandpa, Dr. Gordon Fink. I would not be the person I am without their love, guidance, and careful proof reading of my thesis. I love you both.

In May 2022, I will graduate with a Master of Science Degree in Neuroscience from [Wake Forest School of Medicine](https://wakehealth.edu). This website is the embodiment of my master's thesis. None of this would be possible if not for the incredible support of my mentors, family, and friends. 

First and foremost, I'd like to thank Ken Kishida. I've been conducting research with him since February 2018 and am incredibly appreciative of his encouragement and support. Dr. Kishida has given me the space to follow my interests with programming and neuroscience especially, and this website is the embodiment of that. Within the Kishida Lab, conversations with L. Paul Sands greatly informed my modeling techniques, for which I am appreciative. Emily DiMarco, Rachel Jones, Angela Jiang, and Brittany Liebenow provided feedback and guidance as I developed my thesis. 

As an undergraduate, Lucy McGowan, S. Mason Garrison, and Staci Hepler had an immeasurable impact on how I understand, and conduct, scientific programming, Bayesian inference, and data analysis. Katy Lack, Melissa Maffeo, Wayne Pratt, and Terry Blumenthal fostered my interest in Neuroscience. I am extremely grateful to have learned from them.

I'd next like to thank my committee members, Drs. Christian Waugh and Todd McFall (and Ken Kishida!) for their support and guidance as I've worked on my thesis. Their input has made it that much better. Also, [Nathaniel Haines](http://haines-lab.com)'s publications greatly improved my understanding of the underlying mathematics behind computational modeling and he provided invaluable feedback on my work. 

To my family, your love and support are everything. Thank you.
