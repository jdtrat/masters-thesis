In this thesis, I combine insights from economics, pyschology, and neuroscience to develop 'Counterfactual Predicted Utility Theory' (CPUT) as a neurobiologically-plausible theory of decision-making under risk. CPUT is inspired by the observation that sub-second fluctuations in the levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine seemingly reflect factual and counterfactual information. I propose that people incorporate anticipated counterfactual events when making risky decisions. This leads to behavior that is considered ‘irrational’ from a classical economic perspective as described by Expected Utility Theory (EUT). To assess the predictive accuracy of CPUT, I compared variations of CPUT and EUT on human choice data from a sure bet or gamble task using hierarchical Bayesian modeling techniques. I quantified model fit with multiple methods. This includes comparing marginal likelihood model evidence and leave-one-out cross validation predictive accuracy. I found that CPUT offers a better explanation for the data collected as part of the sure-bet or gamble task while EUT is more likely to generalize to other (similar) datasets. While these results do not provide conclusive evidence favoring CPUT, they suggest a possible role for the integration of counterfactual information in risky decision-making that warrants future investigation.
