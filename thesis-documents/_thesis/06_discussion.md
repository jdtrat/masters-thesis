# Discussion & Next Steps

The modeling results described in the last chapter highlight the nuances of model comparison in terms of predicting choice behavior on the sure-bet or gamble task. The 'CPUT + Softmax Sensitivity' estimated the joint posterior distribution for $\gamma$ and $\tau$ while the 'EUT + Softmax Sensitivity' model fit the joint posterior distribution for $\rho$ and $\tau$. The CPUT model seemingly offers a better explanation of *the observed data*. Indeed, the log of the Bayes Factor here is 48.6, which provides a fair amount evidence in favor of CPUT over EUT. Further, in examining the hypothesis that $\gamma > 0$ as evidence in favor of CPUT, we can look at the average posterior distributions (depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:population-level-post-param-figure) and see that they don't contain zero.[^discussion-1] At the same time, the ELPD and LOOIC suggest that expected utility theory is a better approximation for *unobserved choice data*. This means that if we asked a new person to complete the sure bet or gamble task, expected utility theory may better predict their data.

[^discussion-1]: For example, the 95 percent highest density interval for the 'CPUT + Softmax Sensitivity' model ranges from 3.3\times 10^{-4} to 0.0147.

The culmination of my goal to develop a neurobiologically plausible theory of decision-making under risk is counterfactual predicted utility theory, CPUT. While I acknowledge the evidence presented here is insufficient to conclude that CPUT is a better theory of decision-making under risk than EUT, it does seem to offer a better explanation for the data collected as part of the sure-bet or gamble task. And the fact that I was able to provide some evidence supporting CPUT as a generative theory of decision-making is exciting! 

Before concluding with future directions for investigating CPUT, I want to highlight a few things:

1. More complex models are not necessarily better. Referring back to Table \@ref(fig:model-fit-summary-table), please note that the model that best fits the observed choice data according to the marginal likelihood is the one that estimated a joint posterior distribution for $\gamma, \tau,$ and $\rho$, 'CPUT + Risk Aversion + Softmax Sensitivity.' The inclusion of the additional parameter did not improve the overall posterior predictive choice accuracy and impaired the ELPD predictive density and LOOIC. For this reason, and to avoid drawing conclusions on a (relatively, at least) overfit model, I did not pay it considerable attention here.

2. A consensus on neural correlates of risk-aversion are still debatable. In 2009, Christopoulous and colleagues reported that activity in the interior frontal gyrus, located near the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, reflected the subjective perception of an option's riskiness but not objective evaluation of risk. Further, they describe that signals of the inferior frontal gyrus integrate with other areas, such as the striatum which was found to be sensitive to changes in magnitude, to inform choice behavior.[@christopoulos_neural_2009] On the other hand, Niv and colleagues did not find behavioral or neural evidence for risk sensitivity involving nonlinear utility functions.[@niv_neural_2012] One possibility they mention in referencing Matthew Rabin and Richard Thaler's 2001 paper on risk aversion[@matthew_rabin_anomalies_2001] is the general incompatability of nonlinear utility functions with small magnitudes.[@niv_neural_2012;] However, Rabin and Thaler assume a strict expected utility maximizer, which was not observed in our data (e.g., the softmax sensitivity parameter did not reflect deterministic choices).

3. The posterior distributions for each model show relatively small shifts. For example, the posterior density for $\tau$ is very similar, aggregating around 1.2 for the 'Expected Value + Softmax Sensitivity', 'CPUT + Softmax Sensitivity', and 'CPUT + Risk Aversion + Softmax Sensitivity' models. This suggests more random choice behavior compared to the 'EUT + Softmax Sensitivity' model which clusters around two. I suspect this trend arises from an association between deterministic choice behavior (utility maximization; higher $\tau$) and more risk-averse behavior (smaller $\rho$) and is a potential area of future research.[^discussion-2]

[^discussion-2]: Also of note is the fact that the posterior distributions for $\tau$ and $\rho$ from the 
'EUT + Softmax Sensitivity' model are in line with previous estimates from reports relating arousal levels to loss-averse choice behavior.[@sokol-hessner2009] 

To now entertain the possibility that CPUT provides a mechanistic explanation for choice behavior, as when discussing EUT, I want to focus on outstanding questions involving the potential neurobiological mechanisms. Specifically, a hitherto unanswered question from Kishida and colleagues 2016 paper[@kishida2016] surrounds the mechanism by which counterfactual prediction errors and reward prediction errors are integrated. One possibility proposed by Montague, Kishida, and colleagues is the serotonin system.[@montague_efficiency_2016] They describe an 'opponent-processing framework' where reward prediction errors and counterfactual prediction errors are independently encoded by distinct neural systems that are integrated through the exchange of dopamine into predominantly serotonergic neurons and vice versa (e.g., cross-loading).[@montague_efficiency_2016; @zhou_corelease_2005] 

In 2021, Kishida and Sands proposed valence-partitioned reinforcement learning framework as part of a 'Dynamic Affective Core' that makes explicit predictions for how the dopaminergic system could interact with an opponent one and inform not only choice behavior in situations with multi-valenced outcomes but also associated subjective experiences and feelings.[@kishida_dynamic_2021] This valence-partitioned framework provides another basis for investigating the asymmetric choice behavior in decisions involving gains and losses.[@kahneman1979; @sokol-hessner2009] Although the neural correlates of such behavior are still under investigation, they are hypothesized to involve the striatum[@tom_neural_2007] and the amygdala, an area of the brain often associated with anxiety and fear.[@sokol-hessner_emotion_2013; @sokol-hessner_psychological_2019] 

To extend the work I presented here, I hope to incorporate the ideas of valence-partitioned reinforcement learning with the counterfactual signaling literature. Working towards the goal of developing a neurobiological theory of decision-making under risk, I will next look at how CPUT predicts choices involving losses. If CPUT's predictions generalize to both the gain and loss domain, I hope to conduct a neuroimaging study to identify the neural correlates of CPUT. Fortunately, I have a pretty good idea of where to look.
