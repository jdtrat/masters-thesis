  In this thesis, I combine insights from economics, pyschology, and neuroscience to contribute towards our understanding of the biological processes underlying human decision-making under risk. Specifically, I (i) develop 'counterfactual utility theory' as an alternative to expected utility theory to explain decision-making under risk; and (ii) assess the predictive accuracy of counterfactual utility theory on human choice data from a sure-bet or gamble task.

# Hello, World {-}

My name is Jonathan Trattner. In May 2022, I will graduate with a Master's of Science Degree in Neuroscience from [Wake Forest School of Medicine](https://wakehealth.edu). This document is the embodiment of my master's thesis.
